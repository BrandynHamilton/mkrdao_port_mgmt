# Vault Robo Advisor

## Currently there are four notebooks: Read below
 - exploratory.ipynb is the initial model submitted for my graduate research project.  
 - vault_robo_advisor_test.ipynb is a more developed prototype of the robo advisor.
 - vault_robo_advisor_rl_v01.ipynb is the current working Reinforcement Learning Robo Advisor.  Run this notebook for latest results.
 - vault_robo_advisor_mvo_v01.ipynb is the current working Mean-Variance Optimization Robo Advisor.  Run this notebook for latest results.  

## Run the requirements.txt file to download dependencies.  
 - Use pip install -r requirements.txt in the project directory.  If you run into any issues I reccomend creating a new python environment and running the command there.
